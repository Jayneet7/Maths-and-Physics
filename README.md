# Maths-and-Physics
Here, I Created 5 different scenes for maths and physics. let me explain each one, 5 Different game scenes for each function.

1. FPS (Name of the scene)
  
In the first scenes, I used vector3 and eular engle to create a simulation of the first-person shooter character, here I created 2 different scripts one script for the player movement for the movement which contains two main functions one is for player movement and the other one is for a jump. Also, for the jump, I learned about the Animation curve with which one can manipulate the jump length and type.
The second script is for the player look for the direction in which player is looking and setup the mouse axis for the directions, there are two functions in that one also one is for the camera rotation for the rotation of the player camera, second is to clamp the camera to appropriate positions.

2.Metrix

In this scene, i created a simulation for rotation of sphere on a circle. because I m using gizmos you can only see the simulation on the scene. gizmos are the illusion of an object on defined points in the scene. here i use matrix 4x4, vector3, and quaternion.euler functionalities. on validate for the creation of list and ondrawgizmos to draw gizmo on the points. in the script, you can add more gizmos from the points, manage length from centre, increase or decrease the speed from Y rotation vector.

3. Destroy

Here in this scene I created a box and make it a breakdown in small pieces with a small explosion from the component window you can change the explosion force and explosion radius.

4. Particle 

In this scene, I created a particle system and by using the script i made them seek towards the particular point, in this case, its a small sphere. you can manipulate the directions of particle system by moving the sphere in the scene.


5. Physics

In this scene, i created a cube and add movement with force and angular speed it's a very simple one where you can see the speed increase in the object's script component.

6. Quaterians

Here, there are two rectangles and "cube2" is the one with script you can manipulate the "cube2" rotation with the mouse cursor and if you want that cube to see towards the "cube1" the code is commented for simulate the curser seek behaviour but you can by uncommenting that one and comment the cursor code.

7. Vector

this one is for vector here i get the player position in the 3d space and try to make enemy follow that, you can see the enemy moving towards the player and as he reaches near the player it slows down. also, you can see the positions in the console with debug logs.

I tried to describe everything i think even you have any doubts ask me I will try to make it clear.
